a grid of size n*m is given.

player A and B are playing a game.

A chooses a row and then the leftmost value(val) that has not been chosen yet, in that row and both players go val floors up.
Initially both are at floor 0.
B chooses a row and then the rightmost value(val) that has not been chosen yet, in that row and both players go val floors down.
floor no. can be negative as well.

n*m <=1e6.
val <=1e3.

find the final floor no. if both of them play optimally.
